# Principles

## Do NOT give up until forced all-in

There will always be a possible chance with continuous tries.

Giving up just give the opportunities away.

## Play advantage rather than disadvantage

Play with quality hands at better position rather than chase for draws.

Rather than chasing behind others, why not leading ahead of others.
