# Principles

## NEVER give up until forced all-in

There will always be a possible chance with continuous tries.

Giving up just give the opportunities away.

## Play advantage rather than disadvantage

Play with quality hands at better position rather than chase for draws.

Rather than chasing behind others, why not leading ahead of others.

## Unnecessary to take huge risk that could be avoidable

It is always more desirable to initiate a battle rather than respond one.

For example, you can push all-in for a pair of 77 or AKo with 20+ BB. But you cannot call all-in for the same hand.

## Bet with polarized range, check with linear range

* Bet with strong hand or weak hand but has great potential(backdoor draw)
* Check with medium hand for show down
* Fold junk hand with no potential

## How to play a pair

* Check with strong hand or medium hand
* Bet with weak hand but with great potential
