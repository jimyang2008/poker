  * CO call

Lesson: should raise more at flop, where
* pot is 48k
* each player had 9k down
* to give a draw 1:4 odd
Assum need raise x, then (x+48)/(x-9)< 4/1, x>28.
So I should raise at least 28, which is roughly 3 times of original bet.

In general,
```
  (P+R):(R-B) < T : 1
  P+R < TR-TB
  R >(P+TB)/(T-1)
```
Quick summary, need to be raise `(Pot+4*Bet)/3`, or in words, 
in order to leave the caller not enough odds with 1:n, bet 1/(n-1) of the total Pot with n more call"
Usually , n should be no more than that 4

LESSION: To bluff as if drawing made, need raise in the amount that is large enough to stop curious player from pay for viewing card. But no need to jam , which would look like a bluff.
