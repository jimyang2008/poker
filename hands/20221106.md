* LESSON: Bad River Bet

The 15000 call on TURN could be an alert, only strong made hand can call, including 55, 7x, AA, Kx, QQ~88

Who can call the bet on RIVER?

Only Kx or 7x, 7x might even fold, but Kx would raise for sure.

So the river bet can only get called(or raised) by Kx, which makes it a BAD bet.
