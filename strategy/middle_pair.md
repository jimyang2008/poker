# Middle pair 55~99

## Things to consider

* position
* number of players
* actions (any limp/open/call/raise)

## Example

Hero: 77 in SB
Preflop:
  UTG bet 2BB
  SB call
  BB raise to 2.7BB
  UTG fold

In this case, SB can call.
If flop shows NO high card, SB can dunk or call.
Otherwise, just fold.
